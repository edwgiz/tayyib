<h1>May peace be with you.</h1>
<p>Well-being and longevity are things everyone desires to have and maintain. For most of us, they are granted freely at
    birth, so we often take our health for granted. However, every gift has its limits.</p>
<p>Here, you'll discover remarkable and unusual solutions, rooted in Quranic narratives and cutting-edge scientific
    research and trials. Let's explore how focusing on food can help expand the limits.</p>
<p>Why should you care about the topic? Since you consider yourself as person of purpose you can do more during your
    life having perfect health.<sup><a href="#ref_1">1</a></sup> The expected improvements include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reduced aging</li>
    <li>Resistance to illnesses and infections</li>
    <li>Clear and rational thinking</li>
    <li>Endurance</li>
    <li>Swiftness</li>
</ul>
<p>The solutions aren't replacements for official medicine, they aim to preserve a body healthy as long as possible
    without doctor's invasion.</p>
<p>Gradually incorporate these practices into your routine, and they can significantly impact your metabolism.
    However, be mindful, and if you experience any discomfort, don't push yourself.</p>

<h1>What is Tayyib Food?</h1>
<p>The Quran introduces concept of <em>tayyib</em><sup><a href="#ref_2">2</a></sup> referring to wholesomeness,
    purity, ethically sourced food that is beneficial for both the body and soul.</p>
<p>So the ingredients are expected to be
<p>
<ul>
    <li>satisfying Halal principles</li>
    <li>natural, organic</li>
    <li>minimally processed</li>
    <li>free from artificial additives</li>
</ul>

<p>Among tremendous variety of food sources and ingredients we will choose the most beneficial, having the highest
    concentration of nutrients. Some of them which are explicitly mentioned in Quran or hadiths will have a special
    mark. At the same time we will strive to reduce the calory consumption. So your body will experience slower aging
    and maintain better overall health.</p>
