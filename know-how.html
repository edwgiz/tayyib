<h1>Know-How</h1>

<p>Basic principles:</p>

<h2>Gradualness</h2>
<p>It could take some time to change the habits, gut microbiome and metabolism to the healthy and improved ones.</p>
<p>Replace one common meal to a healthy version, life with it for two weeks and move to the next replacement.
    Assuming three meals a day there are 21 meals a week while one meal replacement requires 2 week adaptation, so
    totally 42 weeks should be enough to build new habits.</p>

<h2>Alive</h2>
<p>Don't process food with high-temperature like a boiling or frying. During millions years of evolution the all animal
    species adapted to pure raw food. Involving high-temperature processing is controversial because</p>
<ul>
    <li>It destroys enzymes participating in apoptosis of consumed cells that leads to excessive efforts in host's
        digestion.
    </li>
    <li>The nutrients break down and degrade, sometimes even transforming into harmful substances. A main outcome is
        lack of vitamins and overflow with calories.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Do the right choice in the favor of fresh, raw and fermented food.</p>

<h2>Diversity</h2>
<p>Let's find as many ingredient varieties as possible.</p>
<p>It's better to spread the all you consume during a whole year between all days, all meals.</p>
<p>Don't concentrate a few ingredients in one meal, other few ones in another meal and so one.</p>
<p>The less amount of specific nutrient is contained in one meal - the better digestion efficiency reached.</p>

<h2>Temperance</h2>
<p>As you gradually replace common foods with healthier options, the change will happen naturally. The old microbiome
    will shift, and you’ll no longer be addicted to any food. One meal a day may become sufficient, making
    intermittent fasting easy to achieve without extra effort, and even enabling longer fasting periods. This approach
    will definitely make your life easier during Ramadan restrictions.</p>
